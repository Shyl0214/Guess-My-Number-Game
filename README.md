Delve into Nostalgia with this retro-inspired ''Guess My Number game'' Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project offers an engaging experience for users to test their guessing skills. The game prompts players to guess a number between 1 and 20, with each incorrect guess decrementing their score. However, landing on the correct number leads to victory and potentially a new high score.

ðŸš€ Key Features:
1. Random generation of the secret number for each game session.
2. Dynamic scoring system that adjusts based on the accuracy of the player's guesses.
3. High score tracking, motivating players to beat their own records.
